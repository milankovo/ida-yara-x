# FindYara-X
![logo](logo.jpg)

Use this IDA python plugin to scan your binary with yara rules. All the yara rule matches will be listed with their offset so you can quickly jump to them!  

**:beers: All credit for this plugin and the code goes to David Berard (@_p0ly_) :beers:**

This plugin is copied from David's excellent [findcrypt-yara plugin](https://github.com/polymorf/findcrypt-yara). This plugin just extends his to use any yara rule. 

## Using FindYara-X
The plugin can be launched from the menu using `Search->Yara-x rules` or using the hot-key combination `Ctrl-Alt-Y`. When launched the FindYara-X will open a file selection dialogue that allows you to select your Yara rules file. Once the rule file has been selected FindYara-X will scan the loaded binary for rule matches. 

All rule matches are displayed in a selection box that allows you to double click the matches and jump to their location in the binary. 

You can also view the list of last 20 scanned rule files by using the `View->Recent yara-x files` menu option. This will display a list of the last 20 rules scanned and allow you to select one to rescan the binary with. You can also delete the rule from the list.

### Rules Not Matching Binary
FindYara scans the loaded PE sections in IDA, this means that yara rules that include matches on the PE header **will not match in IDA**. IDA does not load the PE header as a scannable section. Also, if you have not selected `Load resources` when loading your binary in IDA then the resources section will be unavailable for scanning. 

This can lead to frustrating situations where a yara rule will match outside of IDA but not when using FindYara. If you encounter this try editing the yara rule to remove the matches on the PE header and resources sections.

## Installing FindYara-X
Before using the plugin you must install the python Yara module in your IDA environment. The simplest way to do this is to use pip from a shell outside of IDA.  
`pip install yara-x`. 

**Do not install the `yara` module by mistake.** The `yara` python module will mess with your `yara-python` module so it must be uninstalled if it was installed by mistake.

Once you have the yara module installed simply copy the latest release of [`find-yara-x.py`](https://github.com/OALabs/findyara-ida/releases) into your IDA plugins directory and you are ready to start Yara scanning!

## ‚ùóCompatibility Issues
FindYara has been developed for use with the __IDA 9+__ and __Python 3__ it is not backwards compatible.
